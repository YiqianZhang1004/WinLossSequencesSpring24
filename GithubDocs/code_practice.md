Following are suggestions for good code practice. 

We have a folder called data in the root folder. 
  - Please put your collected data as a csv file in that folder.
  - Please name the .csv file in a way that is clear and easy to read. You may discuss with each other what name convention you want to use.
  - Avoid spaces in filenames, use underscores or dashes instead.
  - See the Fall 2023 github site for examples of good  file naming conventions. E.g., nfl_elo.csv is a file containing NFL game results with Elo-based predictions, nfl_elo_accuracy.csv is the same file with an additional column indicating the accuracy of the prediction. In our case, as we may be using data from multiple sources, it would be good to include the datasource (e.g., cfbd for collegefootballdata.com) as part of the filename.
  - Use descriptive/self-explanatory headers for the csv files. If additional explanations are needed, put them in a readme file, in markdown (.md) format, named appropriately, e.g., cfbd_readme.md.
  - If you compose any code to help to collect the data, please put your code in the seperate folder Data/<yourfolder>/src/.
