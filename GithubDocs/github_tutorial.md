For people not familiar with github. Github is like a shared folder with version control.
  - to get started, clone this github repo to your local computer
  - everytime you start working on your local repo, **pull** the repo before any changes
  - work on the repo as a normal folder on your local computer
  - when you are sure about your change, **commit** your changes, remember to describe your change clearly when commit comments so that everyone else understand what happened
  - **push** your commit to the repo, this will update the online version to everyone
