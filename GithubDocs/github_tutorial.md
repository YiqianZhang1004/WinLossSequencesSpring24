For people not familiar with github. Github is like a shared folder with version control.
  - to get started, clone this github repo to your local computer
  - whenever you start working on this repo on your local computer, first **pull** the repo, and then work on the repo as a normal folder
  - when you are sure about your change, **commit** your changes, remember to describe your change clearly when commit so that everyone else understand what happened
  - **push** your to commit sync it to everyone
