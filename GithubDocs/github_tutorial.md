For people not familiar with github. Github is like a shared folder with version control.
  - to get started, clone this github repo to your local computer
  - everytime you start working on your local repo, **pull** the repo before any changes
  - work on the repo as a normal folder on your local computer
  - when you are sure about your change, **commit** your changes, remember to describe your change clearly when commit comments so that everyone else understand what happened.
  - Make sure to first **add** any new files that you want to be part of the github repo  before running the commit command. Files that have not been added will be ignored when pushing your changes to github; this is a convenient feature that allows you, for example, to test things out locally without having to worry that your test files will show up at the github repo.
  - **push** your commit to the repo, this will update the online version to everyone
