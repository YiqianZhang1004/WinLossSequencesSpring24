This is a temporary readme and is meant to be replaced by well-written introductions to our project as we make progress. Some of us may know more than I do, so if you have better idea feel free to modify the instructions below.

Following are suggestions for good code practice. 
For now, we have an folder called data. 
  - Please put the csv file you found there.
  - Please name the .csv file in a way that is clear and easy to read. You may discuss with each other what name convention you want to use.
    *Additional tips:*
      - Avoid spaces in filenames, use underscores or dashes instead.
      - See the Fall 2023 github site for examples of good  file naming conventions. E.g., nfl_elo.csv is a file containing NFL game results with Elo-based predictions, nfl_elo_accuracy.csv is the same file with an additional column indicating the accuracy of the prediction. In our case, as we may be using data from multiple sources, it would be good to include the datasource (e.g., cfbd for collegefootballdata.com) as part of the filename.
      - Use descriptive/self-explanatory headers for the csv files. If additional explanations are needed, put them in a readme file, in markdown (.md) format, named appropriately, e.g., cfbd_readme.md.
    
  - If you write up any code yourself when getting the data, please also put your code in Data/<yourfolder>/<yourcode>. Remember to name your folder in a good way. I recommend to use the website domain name.
